      <description>Hi, it&amp;rsquo;s me again! In this blog post I would like to talk about what I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning by taking the course CS-EJ4101 &amp;ldquo;Introduction to DevOps&amp;rdquo;; maybe I can convince you to take it as well! This is a 1 ECTS course on DevOps, and consists of some quizzes about DevOps and a project. The project entices creating a blog using Hugo and then automatically deploying it using Travis CI.</description>

      <description>I chose to take this course because I needed to improve my grade for the course CS-E4100. So, I asked the professor if there was any way to do that, and he suggested I take this course. I thought that was a really good idea, since it would allow me to:
 increase the grade; learn about DevOps; improve my skillset; learn more technologies, like Hugo and also Travis CI, that are very requested in industry.</description>
