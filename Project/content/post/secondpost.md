Hi, it's me again!
In this blog post I would like to talk about what I've been learning by taking the course CS-EJ4101 "Introduction to DevOps"; maybe I can convince you to take it as well!
This is a 1 ECTS course on DevOps, and consists of some quizzes about DevOps and a project. The project entices creating a blog using Hugo and then automatically deploying it using Travis CI.

So far, I've been concentrating on learning how to use Hugo.
Hugo is an open-sourse static site generator that allows to build websites like blogs starting from MarkDown content.

It is quite fun to learn and with the help of Hugo themese the blogs can be quite fun and customizable, without the need to delve into the whole HTML-CSS paradigm. In fact, themes automatically style your pages for you, so you can give the whole site a cohesive look without writing even 1 line of CSS. I think this is amazing especially for begineers of non-technical people who are not used to coding but would still like to build a website because the skills required are very little and you can build a quite good looking site!

It was a bit confusing at first, but I got the hang of it and this blog is tangible proof of that! I think it is a nice resource and it creates quite clean sites with relatively little work.

In the next steps of the course, I will try to deploy the website automatically using Travis CI.
I have never done this so it may be a bit of a challenge but I'm sure it'll be totally doable and the result will be worth it!
