I chose to take this course because I needed to improve my grade for the course CS-E4100. So, I asked the professor if there was any way to do that, and he suggested I take this course.
I thought that was a really good idea, since it would allow me to:

- increase the grade;
- learn about DevOps;
- improve my skillset;
- learn more technologies, like Hugo and also Travis CI, that are very requested in industry.

I hope in this course I can learn to setup Travis CI to create a Continuous Integration pipeline, and how to integrate it with other technologies like Git. I also got a good understanding of DevOps practices through the online video material, which I think is a very current topic. Learning DevOps can be beneficial in many ways, from having a better hiring potential to being more efficient and improve productivity.

I think these are topics very relevant in industry and it's important to learn them and be able to use them. I unfortunately didn't really get a chance to work on the CI/CD pipeline in the project of the CS-E4100 course since some of my teammates already had a lot of experience so they took care of that; this course could be an opportunity to learn more about that!

Ultimately, I think that good practices are very important in the life of a software developer, and the sooner these practices are incorporated into the life of the programmer, the better. Trying to change your modus operandi AFTER it is already established can be extremely difficult, so it is a very good idea to learn about DevOps in university and try to implement its methods already from the start of one's career.
